# HS402_WiFi_Adapters

Description:
Those are adapter boards that will allow you to use the HS402 oscilloscope wirelessly via an ESP32 NodeMCU (WROOM32 or WROOM32D).

The adapter board was designed to allow a 30 pin (Version_1) or 38 pin (Version_2) NodeMCU (WROOM32 or WROOM32D) to be stacked on top of an STM32F411.
 
!!! Before ordering this PCB adapter, ensure that your ESP32 NodeMCU board pinout (30 pin) is exactly as the one shown in the picture [ESP32_30pin_Layout]!!!
!!! Before ordering this PCB adapter, ensure that your ESP32 NodeMCU board pinout (38 pin) is exactly as the one shown in the picture [ESP32_38pin_Layout]!!!
 
See detailed assembling steps for Version 1 (30 pins ESP32 NodeMCU) in the Readme.pdf of the Version_1.

For Version 2 (38 pins ESP32 NodeMCU) please follow the same steps.


Notes:

This adapter board is not the official WiFi adapter for HS402 oscilloscope.
So this design is not maintained or suported by the developer of HS402 oscilloscope. 
This adapter is a reduced version with fewer functions (no voltage monitoring and no RGB LED indications).
Order it only after you understand his limitations.
